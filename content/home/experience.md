  - title: Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Payload System Engineer
    company: NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory
    company_url: 'https://mars.nasa.gov/mro/'
    location: Pasadena, California
    date_start: '2001-01-01'
    date_end: '2004-01-01'
    description: |2-
       **The Mars Reconnaissace Orbiter** continues to provide unprecedented spatial and spectral observations of the Martian surface and atmosphere. As a payload engineer, I was an interface between the instrument teams and the spacecraft team through the early phases of the mission development (Phase A through C, in NASA lingo). I specifically worked with the instrument teams responsible for the Context Camera Experiment (CTX), the Mars Climate Imager (MARCI), and the Mars Climate Sounder (MCS). 

  - title: Deep Impact Science System Engineer
    company: NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory
    company_url: 'https://mars.nasa.gov/mro/'
    location: Pasadena, California
    date_start: '2002-01-01'
    date_end: '2004-07-31'
    description: |2-
       I was lucky to be invited to work on the **Deep Impact science team as a science system engineer**. Working with one of the Deep Impact co-Investigators, Ken Klaasen, I was responsible for developing the lunar calibration observations as well as the training for science operations during flight. Both graduate school and personal events kept me from participating in the encounter, but when the Deep Impact impactor vehicle struck the Temple-1 comet, I was awake in the middle of the night savoring the images from this innovative mission.
