After a great half year in Colorado working with [Dr. Jeffrey Andrews-Hanna](http://inside.mines.edu/~jcahanna/) I have returned to Pasadena, California to again collaborate with [Dr. Tapio Schneider](http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~tapio). Dr. Schneider and I will be investigating the methane cycle on current Titan with an emphasis on understanding the large scale processes that influence precipitation, both seasonally and secularly. Although I am still working on various Mars projects, I am excited to tackle a different terrestrial planet, particularly a slowly rotating planet with a thick atmosphere. There will be some interesting new physics to learn.
