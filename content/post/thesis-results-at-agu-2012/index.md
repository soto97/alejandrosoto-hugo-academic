The second stop of my thesis results world tour was the [2012 American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting](http://fallmeeting.agu.org/2012/), which is held every year in downtown San Francisco at the Moscone convention center. This was a short trip for me, since I did not stay the whole week, but I did have four hours of conversations about my [poster](/docs/Soto_AGU2012_poster.pdf), which was a lot of fun.
