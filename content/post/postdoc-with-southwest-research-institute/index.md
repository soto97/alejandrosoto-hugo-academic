The arrival of 2013 brings a new home and new job for me. A few weeks ago I started as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Planetary Science Directorate](http://www.boulder.swri.edu) of the [Southwest Research Institute (SwRI)](http://www.swri.edu), where I will continue to study the Titan atmospheric dynamics. The SwRI Boulder office has a great group of planetary scientists working on a number of projects, from exoplanets to [planetary formation](http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~kretke/Research.html) to [solar system dynamics](http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~hal/) to [planetary geology](http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~hamilton/VEH/Home.html) to [planetary atmospheres](http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~rafkin/). Plus, they are in charge of the [Juno mission](http://missionjuno.swri.edu) and the [New Horizons Pluto mission](http://pluto.jhuapl.edu). This will be a fun place to work, and the fact that I will be living in [Boulder, CO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder,_Colorado) is just a bonus.
