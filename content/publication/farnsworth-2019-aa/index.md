abstract: "Titan's surface liquids are composed primarily of methane, ethane, and\
  \ dissolved atmospheric nitrogen. The nitrogen content depends on the alkane composition\
  \ and temperature, and exsolves as bubbles when these parameters are sufficiently\
  \ perturbed. Herein, we present an experimental study of nitrogen bubbles in methane–ethane\
  \ liquids, and propose that both methane and ethane are required for bubbles to\
  \ form under Titan conditions. Bubbles occur when methane composes 40–95 mol% of\
  \ the alkanes within the liquid. We identify two mechanisms that produce bubbles:\
  \ ethane mediated titration and temperature‐induced stratification. Both of these\
  \ mechanisms produce a metastable nitrogen supersaturation within the liquid; equilibration\
  \ triggers rapid nitrogen exsolution in the form of bubbles. Such equilibration\
  \ could cause bubble events in Titan's lakes, possibly explaining the transient\
  \ “Magic Island” features seen by Cassini RADAR (bubbles within the liquid column),\
  \ and the presence of deltas in Ontario Lacus."
