abstract: One of the key components of a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR)
  is the linear translation stage used to vary the optical path length between the
  two arms of the interferometer. This translation mechanism must produce extremely
  constant velocity motion across its entire range of travel to allow the instrument
  to attain high signal-to-noise ratio and spectral resolving power. A new spectrometer
  is being developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory under NASA’s Planetary Instrument
  Definition and Development Program (PIDDP). The goal of this project is to build
  upon existing spaceborne FTIR spectrometer technology to produce a new instrument
  prototype that has drastically superior spectral resolution and substantially lower
  mass, making it feasible for planetary exploration. In order to achieve these goals,
  Alliance Spacesystems, Inc. (ASI) has developed a linear translation mechanism using
  a novel ultrasonic piezo linear motor in conjunction with a fully kinematic, fault
  tolerant linear rail system. The piezo motor provides extremely smooth motion, is
  inherently redundant, and is capable of producing unlimited travel. The kinematic
  rail uses spherical Vespel rollers and bushings, which eliminates the need for
  wet lubrication, while providing a fault tolerant platform for smooth linear motion
  that will not bind under misalignment or structural deformation. This system can
  produce velocities from 10 – 100 mm/s with less than 1% velocity error over the
  entire 100-mm length of travel for a total mechanism mass of less than 850 grams.
  This system has performed over half a million strokes under vacuum without excessive
  wear or degradation in performance. This paper covers the design, development, and
  testing of this linear translation mechanism as part of the Planetary Atmosphere
  Occultation Spectrometer (PAOS) instrument prototype development program.
