abstract: Saturn's moon Titan is the only extraterrestrial body known to host stable
  lakes and a hydrological cycle. Titan's lakes predominantly contain liquid methane,
  ethane, and nitrogen, with methane evaporation driving its hydrological cycle. Molecular
  interactions between these three species lead to nonideal behavior that causes Titan's
  lakes to behave differently than Earth's lakes. Here, we numerically investigate
  how methane evaporation and nonideal interactions affect the physical properties,
  structure, dynamics, and evolution of shallow lakes on Titan. We find that, under
  certain temperature regimes, methane-rich mixtures are denser than relatively ethane-rich
  mixtures. This allows methane evaporation to stratify Titan's lakes into ethane-rich
  upper layers and methane-rich lower layers, separated by a strong compositional
  gradient. At temperatures above 86 K, lakes remain well mixed and unstratified.
  Between 84 and 86 K, lakes can stratify episodically. Below 84 K, lakes permanently
  stratify and develop very methane-depleted epilimnia. Despite small seasonal and
  diurnal deviations (<5 K) from typical surface temperatures, Titan's rain-filled
  ephemeral lakes and \"phantom lakes\" may nevertheless experience significantly
  larger temperature fluctuations, resulting in polymictic or even meromictic stratification,
  which may trigger ethane ice precipitation.
