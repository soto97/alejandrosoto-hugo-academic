abstract: Global energy balance models of the martian atmosphere predict that, for
  a range of total CO2 inventories, the CO2 atmosphere may condense until a state
  with a permanent polar cap is reached. This process, which is commonly referred
  to as atmospheric collapse, may limit the time available for physical and chemical
  weathering. The global energy balance models that predict atmospheric collapse represent
  the climate using simplified parameterizations for atmospheric processes such as
  radiative transfer and atmospheric heat transport. However, a more detailed representation
  of these atmospheric processes is critical when the atmosphere is near a transition,
  such as the threshold for collapse. Therefore, we use the Mars Weather Research
  and Forecasting (MarsWRF) general circulation model (GCM) to investigate how the
  explicit representation of meridional heat transport and more detailed radiative
  transfer affects the onset of atmospheric collapse. Using MarsWRF, we find that
  previous energy balance modeling underestimates the range of CO2 inventories for
  which the atmosphere collapses and that the obliquity of Mars determines the range
  of CO2 inventories that can collapse. For a much larger range of CO2 inven- tories
  than expected, atmospheric heat transport is insufficient to prevent the atmospheric
  collapse. We show that the condensation of CO2 onto Olympus Mons and adjacent mountains
  generates a condensa- tion flow. This condensation flow syphons energy that would
  otherwise be transported poleward, which helps explain the large range of CO2 inventories
  for which the atmosphere collapses.
