abstract: Special Regions on Mars are defined as environments able to host liquid
  water that simultaneously meets certain temperature and water activity requirements
  that allow known terrestrial organisms to replicate and therefore could be habitable.
  Such regions would be of concern for planetary protection policies owing to the
  potential for forward contamination (biological contamination from Earth). Pure
  liquid water is unstable on the Martian surface but brines may be present. Experimental
  work has shown that brines persist beyond their predicted stability region, leading
  to metastable liquids. Here we show that (meta)stable brines can form and persist
  from the equator to high latitudes on the surface of Mars for a few percent of the
  year for up to six consecutive hours, a broader range than previously thought. However,
  only the lowest eutectic solutions can form, leading to brines with temperatures
  of less than 225 K. Our results indicate that (meta)stable brines on the Martian
  surface and its shallow subsurface (a few centimetres deep) are not habitable because
  their water activities and temperatures fall outside the known tolerances for terrestrial
  life. Furthermore, (meta)stable brines do not meet the Special Region requirements,
  reducing the risk of forward contamination and easing threats related to the exploration
  of the Martian surface.
