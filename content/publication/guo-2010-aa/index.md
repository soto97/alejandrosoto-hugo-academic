abstract: A perennial ice cap has long been observed near the south pole of Mars.
  The surface of this cap is predominantly composed of carbon dioxide ice. The retention
  of a CO2 ice cap results from the surface energy balance of the latent heat, solar
  radiation, surface emission, subsurface conduction, and atmospheric sensible heat.
  While models conventionally treat surface CO2 ice using constant ice albedos and
  emissivities, such an approach fails to predict the existence of a perennial cap.
  Here we explore the role of the insolation‚Äêdependent ice albedo, which agrees well
  with Viking, Mars Global Surveyor, and Mars Express albedo observations. Using a
  simple parameterization within a general circulation model, in which the albedo
  of CO2 ice responds linearly to the incident solar insolation, we are able to predict
  the existence of a perennial CO2 cap at the observed latitude and only in the southern
  hemisphere. Further experiments with different total CO2 inventories, planetary
  obliquities, and surface boundary conditions suggest that the location of the residual
  cap may exchange hemispheres favoring the pole with the highest peak insolation.
