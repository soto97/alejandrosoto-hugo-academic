abstract: Titan's abundant lakes and seas exchange methane vapor and energy with the
  atmosphere via a process generally known as air-sea interaction. This turbulent
  exchange process is investigated with an atmospheric mesoscale model coupled to
  a slab model representation of an underlying lake. The impact of lake size, effective
  lake mixed layer depth, background wind speed, air-lake temperature differential,
  and atmospheric humidity on air-sea interaction processes is studied through dozens
  of two-dimensional simulations. The general, quasi-steady solution is a non-linear
  superposition of a very weak background plume circulation driven by the buoyancy
  of evaporated methane with a stronger opposing thermally direct (sea breeze) circulation
  driven by the thermal contrast between the cold marine layer over the lake and the
  warmer inland air. The specific solution depends on the value of selected atmosphere
  and lake property parameters, but the general solution of the superposition of these
  two circulations is persistent. Consistent with previous analytical work of others,
  the sensible heat flux and the latent heat flux trend toward opposite and equal
  values such that their ratio, the Bowen ratio, approaches −1.0 in most, but not
  all, of the quasi-steady state solutions. Importantly, in nearly all scenarios,
  the absolute magnitude of the fluxes trends toward very small values such that the
  equilibrium solution is also nearly a trivial solution where air-sea energy exchange
  is ~3 W m−2 or less. In all cases, a cool, moist, and statically stable shallow
  marine layer with nearly calm winds and small turbulent flux exchanges with a colder
  underlying lake is produced by the model. The temperature of the lake, the marine
  properties of the air, and the strength of the sea breeze depends on the initial
  conditions and to a lesser degree, the boundary conditions.
