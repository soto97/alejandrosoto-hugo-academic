abstract: Wind-blown dunes are a record of the climatic history in Titan’s equatorial
  region. Through modeling of the climatic conditions associated with Titan’s historical
  orbital configurations (arising from apsidal precessions of Saturn’s orbit), we
  present evidence that the orientations of the dunes are influenced by orbital forcing.
  Analysis of 3 Titan general circulation models (GCMs) in conjunction with a sediment
  transport model provides the first direct intercomparison of results from different
  Titan GCMs. We report variability in the dune orientations predicted for different
  orbital epochs of up to 70°. Although the response of the GCMs to orbital forcing
  varies, the orbital influence on the dune orientations is found to be significant
  across all models. Furthermore, there is near agreement among the two models run
  with surface topography, with 3 out of the 5 dune fields matching observation for
  the most recent orbital cycle. Through comparison with observations by Cassini,
  we find situations in which the observed dune orientations are in best agreement
  with those modeled for previous orbital configurations or combinations thereof,
  representing a larger portion of the cycle. We conclude that orbital forcing could
  be an important factor in governing the present-day dune orientations observed on
  Titan and should be considered when modeling dune evolution.
