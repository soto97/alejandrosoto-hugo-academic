abstract: "We present a comprehensive imaging and spectroscopic survey of optical\
  \ emission knots associated with the young Galactic supernova remnant 3C 58. Hα\
  \ images show hundreds of clumpy filaments and knots arranged in a complex structure\
  \ covering a nearly circular area roughly 400 '' in diameter. A quite different\
  \ emission structure is seen in [O III], where the brightest features are less clumpy\
  \ and largely confined to the remnant's northwest quadrant. Measured radial velocities\
  \ of over 450 knots reveal two distinct kinematic populations; one with average\
  \ and peak expansion velocities of 770 and 1100 km s −1 , respectively, forming\
  \ a thick shell, and the other showing | v | ≤ 250 km s −1 . High-velocity knots\
  \ ( | v | ≥ 500 km s −1 ) exhibit a strong bipolar expansion pattern with redshifted\
  \ and blueshifted knots located in northeastern and southwestern regions, respectively.\
  \ These knots also show strong [N II]/Hα line emission ratios, suggesting enhanced\
  \ N/H. In contrast, the slower expanding knot population shows much lower [N II]/Hα\
  \ line ratios and likely represents circumstellar mass loss material from the 3C\
  \ 58 progenitor. Proper-motion estimates using images spanning a 28 yr time interval\
  \ suggest positional shifts of between 0.5 '' and 2.0 '', implying proper motions\
  \ of 0.02 ''-0.07 '' yr −1 . These values agree with previous estimates but are\
  \ much less than the ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] ≈ 0.2 ''\
  \ yr −1 expected if 3C 58 were associated with historic guest star of 1181 CE."
