abstract: As we continue to discover terrestrial exoplanets, many with orbital and
  planetary characteristics drastically different from anything encountered in our
  solar system, we are likely to encounter 'exotic' atmospheric transport processes.
  As an example, we show an analysis of meridional transport from simulations Mars.
  These simulations provide insight into the differences in meridional transport between
  Earth and Mars, particularly through the role of a condensation flow. The differences
  between Earth and Mars are a reminder that there may be a wide variety of meridional
  transport processes at work across the range of observed terrestrial planets.
