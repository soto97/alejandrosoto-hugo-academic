abstract: Presented here is a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) for field
  studies that serves as a prototype for future Mars science applications. Infrared
  spectroscopy provides chemical information that is relevant to a number of Mars
  science questions. This includes mineralogical analysis, nitrogen compound recognition,
  truth testing of remote sensing measurements, and the ability to detect organic
  compounds. The challenges and scientific opportunities are given for the in situ
  FTIR analysis of Mars soil and rock samples. Various FTIR sampling techniques are
  assessed and compared to other analytical instrumentation. The prototype instrument
  presented is capable of providing field analysis in a Mars analog Antarctic environment.
  FTIR analysis of endolithic microbial communities in Antarctic rocks and a Mars
  meteor are given as analytical examples.
