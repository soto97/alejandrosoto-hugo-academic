abstract: We explore the use of microstructured semiconductor neutron detectors (MSNDs)
  to map the ratio between thermal neutrons and higher energy neutrons. The system
  consists of alternating layers of modular neutron detectors (MNDs), each comprising
  arrays of twenty-four MSNDs, and high-density polyethylene moderators (HDPE) with
  gadolinium shielding to filter between thermal neutrons and higher energy neutrons.
  We experimentally measured the performance of three different configurations and
  demonstrated that the sensor system prototypes detect and differentiate thermal
  and epithermal neutrons. We discuss future planetary exploration applications of
  this compact, semiconductor-based low-energy neutron detection system.
