I am a Research Scientist at the [Southwest Research Institute (SwRI)](http://www.swri.edu/), where I work in the [Planetary Science Directorate](http://www.boulder.swri.edu) in [Boulder, CO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder,_Colorado). I study the climate dynamics of terrestrial atmospheres through the use atmospheric models of varying complexity, including general circulation models and mesoscale models. I am also involved in instrument development, using new laser based techniques to observe atmospheres and surfaces both in situ and remotely. Finally, I am a member of the [Project ESPRESSO](https://www.espresso.institute) team, which is a virtual institute funded by NASA's <a href="https://sservi.nasa.gov">SSERVI</a> program to enable and enhance future solar system exploration by developing the tools and techniques that both robotic and human explorers will need.

In the not too distant past, I was an engineer at the [Jet Propulsion Laboratory](http://www.jpl.nasa.gov). I worked on a wide range of projects, from advanced concept design to technology development to flight development to operations. I continue to combine this instrument experience with my scientific research.
